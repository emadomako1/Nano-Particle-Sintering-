Nanoparticle Sintering

1. Use ASE to generate initial configurations of metallic nanoparticles eg: you can use Icosahedron('Au', 4) and Icosahedron('Cu', 4)
2. Simulate the sintering process in LAMMPS by applying appropriate temperature ramps (300 to 1200 K then from  1200 to 300).
3. Monitor the neck growth between particles and study the kinetics of sintering in Ovito.
4. Calculate properties such as formation energy, migration barriers, electronic structures and other correlated parameters.
